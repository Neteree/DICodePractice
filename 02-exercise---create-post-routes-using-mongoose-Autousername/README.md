# 02 Exercise - Create `POST` routes using Mongoose

## Brief

Complete the following API Specification, and save the data into MongoDB using Mongoose. 

## Getting started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start` to start the Express API server
3. Start MongoDB in Docker by opening a terminal and `copy & paste` in the following: 
```shell
docker run --name 02-exercise-mongoose-post-routes-mongo_db \
  -p 27017:27017 \
  -v 02-exercise-run-mongoose-post-routes-mongodb_data_container:/data/db \
  -d \
  mongo
``` 
NOTE: You do not need to import any data, your `POST` routes will create the data!
4. Open `./src/app.js` in VS Code. Note that some `GET` routes already exist.
5. The Mongoose Models are already created and imported to the top of `app.js`. Use them to create new documents in MongoDB. The models also automatically convert `_id` to `id`, so you do not need any transformation steps.
6. Add the `POST` routes to complete the API specification.
