# 02 Exercise - Test `POST` routes using Supertest and Jest

## Brief

Write integration tests for the `POST` routes of an existing Express/MongoDB application.

## Getting started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Start MongoDB in Docker by opening a terminal and `copy & paste` in the following: 
```shell
docker run --name 02-exercise-test-post-routes-mongo_db \
  -p 27017:27017 \
  -v 02-exercise-test-post-routes-mongo_db_data_container:/data/db \
  -d \
  mongo
``` 
NOTE: You do not need to import any data, your `POST` routes will create the data!
3. Write tests in `app.test.js` for the `POST` routes.
4. Type `npm test` to run the tests you write.
