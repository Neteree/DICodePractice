# User Story

- As the real estate agent for House Tricks
- I want to add a new property to the website
- So potential customers can view and purchase the property

## Acceptance criteria

- When navigating to the [Add property](http://localhost:3000/add) route in the React Application, then a form is displayed that has inputs for all the property details
  - **Label:** Title, **Input:** text, **Required:** true
  - **Label:** Asking Price, **Input:** text, **Required:** true
  - **Label:** Description, **Input:** text, **Required:** true
  - **Label:** Address, **Input:** text, **Required:** true
  - **Label:** Image URL, **Input:** text, **Required:** true
- The labels have [`htmlFor`](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#htmlfor) attributes, that link to the input id. 
  - Watch the [htmlFor attribute in React tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/2bdb9bd6ce194299ae95c42cc59e523a) that explains the `htmlFor` attribute
- The form submit button text is `Submit`.
- When the submit button is clicked, then an API request is made to create a new property, using the values from the form inputs
- When the API response is successful, then the customer is redirected back to the homepage route (`"/"`)
